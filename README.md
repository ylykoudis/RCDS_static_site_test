# Material for MkDocs Template

Click [**Use this template**](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/RCDS-mkdocs-material-template/generate) for the quickest method of getting started with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

What's in this README?

A README is the starting point for anyone looking to learn more about a project on GitHub.
The .md file format tells you that this file will be rendered in Markdown.

GitHub uses a special flavour of Markdown, called GitHub Flavoured Markdown.

This README will give you some practice with Markdown, and help you create your first MkDocs site.

<!-- This is a comment, which will not appear in the rendered Markdown -->
<!-- We'll use comments in this README to suggest improvements to make! -->


<!-- Add some emphasis to the paragraph below. Surround words or phrases with * _ or ` -->

Unfortunately, this README has very little Markdown in it. Before we get into MkDocs,
let's improve the aesthetics in this file. While editing, you can toggle into Preview mode.

<!-- Next up, headings. Add one or more hashtags before a line to make it a heading -->
<!-- More hashtags mean a deeper level subheading. Make Getting Started a level 2 heading. -->

Getting Started

Important!!

In your newly created repository, complete the following:

<!-- Next, ordered lists. Prefix each block below with a number and full stop ( 1. ) -->

Give GitHub Actions Read and write permissions on this repo
Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow Permissions

Enable GitHub Pages
Settings -> Pages -> Build & Deployment -> Source -> GitHub Actions

Change respository name
Click on `_config.yml` -> Edit this file -> `repository:` -> (replace with your username/repository)

<!-- More headings. Make What's Included and Checklist level 3 headings. -->

<!-- Now, unordered lists. Prefix each line below with - ( you can also use + or * ) -->

<!-- Another heading. This could be a level 2 heading again. -->

Going Further

If you are working locally you can install Material for Mkdocs with pip, like so

<!-- To render code blocks, we use 3 backticks ``` , on the line above and the line below.  -->
<!-- Optionally, you can write the language after the opening backticks e.g. ```python  -->

pip install mkdocs-material

<!-- For links, surround link text with square brackets and the URL with round parentheses [TEXT](URL) -->

Those are a few of the basics, but there is lots more to explore. This is a great resource from GitHub https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax

This material was developed by the RCDS team at ECRI.
